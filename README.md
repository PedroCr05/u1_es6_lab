## Getting Started
- Fork and Clone
- Put your answers to the questions in this readme in the `solutions.js` file

## Part 1 - Spreading Out

  1. Define two arrays, fruits and vegetables filled with their respective content.
  2. Using the spread operator, make a new array 'produce' that contains all of the fruits and vegetables
  3. Make another 3 arrays: Beef, Seafood, Poultry. 
  4. Use the Spread Operator to join these all as an array called Meat
  5. Merge your Meat and Produce to make a large array called Foods


## Part 2 - Merging Objects

  1. Define an object faveFoods that has keys representing three of your favorite foods and the values should be the restaurant or locale where they are from.
  2. Now make another object and do the same thing but this time ask your teammates what their three favorite foods are. .
  3. Using the spread operator, build a final object allFoods with the items from faveFoods and teamFaveFoods together.

## Part 3 - Destructuring

  1. Define yourself in a javascript Object with three keys: name, age, and hometown.
  2. Use the destructuring syntax to extract all three keys into variables. Log all three variables.
  3. Now we are going to give you a pet. _Use destructuring_ to do the following: 1) add a pet object to your person, 2) define three variables (age, breed, name) outside of the object and 3) add those variables to your pet. 
  4. Log the most important thing about you: your pet's name.
